# Dungeon-Master

A simple remake of the old DOS classic - Dungeon Master.

All done in Vanilla Javascript. So far I got the maze system to work and display correctly in the pseudo-3d window.
Need to tidy up the code and make it more dry. 
More things to come(hero stats, monsters, fight system, treasures, etc).
